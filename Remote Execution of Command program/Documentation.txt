Q) First of all what is "socket"?

Ans) Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. 
     One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection.
     Server forms the listener socket while client reaches out to the server.
     They are the real backbones behind web browsing. In simpler terms there is a server and a client.    
     Socket programming is started by importing the socket library and making a simple socket.
     
     import socket
     s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    
     Here we made a socket instance and passed it two parameters. The first parameter is AF_INET and the second one is SOCK_STREAM. 
     AF_INET refers to the address family ipv4. The SOCK_STREAM means connection oriented TCP protocol.
