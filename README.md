# Advance-Backdoor-Program

## :page_facing_up:Project Descripttion
This is a fully functional Backdoor program, which is made in python 2. It includes many useful and important functions which are related to CyberSecurity and Hacking.


By the grace of Almight Allah I have successfuly completed my python "ADVANCE BACKDOOR PROJECT".This program is written in python 2.
I will make you understand the complete working of this program. So get ready! and tight your seat belts!.Oh wait! wait! wait! 
I am just kidding,so don't be seriouly tie up yourselfs. So lets come on to the topic.The first thing you should understand is "socket" 
beacuse my whole program depends on this. 


### Q)   What is "socket" in python programming?

Ans) Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. 
One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection.
Server forms the listener socket while client reaches out to the server.
They are the real backbones behind web browsing. In simpler terms there is a server and a client.    
Socket programming is started by importing the socket library and making a simple socket.
" import socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) "
    
Here we made a socket instance and passed it two parameters. The first parameter is AF_INET and the second one is SOCK_STREAM. 
AF_INET refers to the address family ipv4. The SOCK_STREAM means connection oriented TCP protocol.You can also name this process as
"Three way hand-shake".Thats all about socket, hope! you may now have fundamental Knowledge of socket. 

#Now except this every thing about code is wriiten in the programms in face of comments.

### HOW TO EFFECTIVELY USE THIS BACKDOOR IN TARGET SYSTEM.

1) Firstly You have to change the the IP in reverseShell  and  Server according to your need.
2) Secondly change this file to executable through Terminal.And during execution also give these commands --onefile --noconsole   
   for remaining anonymous in this way when terget will open the file the ReverseShell will not oopen on Desktop rather it will open in background
   and if target deletes the program from task Manager .Then it dosent matter because in my program i have set this codition due to which target can neither
   delete the program nor it can end the task beacuse after every 15 second the progarm will execute automatically.
3) You  can also embed this program in image file but i can not tell that process here
